## BBox-Label-Tool

A simple tool for labeling object bounding boxes in images, implemented with Python Tkinter.

Changes have been made from the [original version](https://github.com/puzzledqs/BBox-Label-Tool) by [puzzledqs](https://github.com/puzzledqs) to be more easily used in conjunction with [darknet](https://github.com/RiccardoGrin/darknet) for a project I worked on. I have written new [instructions](https://github.com/RiccardoGrin/darknet#2---labeling) of how to use this after the changes.
